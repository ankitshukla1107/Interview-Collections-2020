1) (Category: Hive) Write code to create a dynamically partitioned table

2) (Category: SQL) Given a employee table with fields as:
EMPID, ENAME, SALARY, MONTH---Assume table is having 10 years of data from 2009 to 2019
Find average salary for each employee by quarter?

3) (Category:SQL) For each year which quarter have the highest sales percentage?
Sales
year quarter	sales 
2017	4	    32000      
2017	3	    49000
2017	2	    78000
2017	1	    55000
2018	1	    32562
2018	2	    69874
2018	3	    8965
2018	4	    41000
2019	1	    85236
2019	2	    96500
2019	3	    75000
2019	4	    87456

O/P â€“ 
year	quarter	sales	% growth
2017	2	78000	    41.81
2018	4	41000	    357.33
2019	4	87456	    16.66

4) Given a sorted array of integers which contains repeated elements in it. Write a function which takesinteger as input and return first and 
last occurance of that integer in O(logn) time complexity?

5) The cost of a stock on each day is given in an array, find the days on which we should buy and sell the stocks so as to obtain maximum profit?
{100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695}

1.	Buy on day 0 and sell on day 3
2.	Buy on day 4 and sell on day 6

6) Given an integer array which contains 0's in it. Move all 0's to the end of array in O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity?

7) Check if two binary trees are mirror of each other or not?

8) Given an array which contains repeatitive elements. Find count of numbers for repeatitive number in array in O(n) time complexity and O(1) 
space complexity?

9) Design and Implement LRU Cache?
